Mobile   Programming Course   Project: Group Assignment
Project Overview:
For this group   project, your task   is to develop a   mobile application   using Android   Studio   with   Kotlin   that incorporates industry-standard technologies. The app should   be   a   solution to   a   real-world   problem and demonstrate   the following   key features:
1.          Data   Handling: The app   must integrate   data
2.          User   Interface: The   app should feature an   intuitive and   user-friendly   interface that follows   modern design   principles, ensuring a good   user experience   (UX).
3.          Real-World   Problem Solving: Choose a   real-world   problem from the   list   below   or   propose   your own   relevant   issue:
o    Environmental   pollution
o    Lack   of   community   support systems
o      Local tourism   promotion
o    Support for small farmers to sell   their   produce
o    Promoting   sustainability   practices
o    Increasing accessibility for   people with   disabilities
o      Reducing food waste
o    Helping   local artisans   market their   products
o    Improving   public transportation access
o    Enhancing   local   disaster   preparedness
o    Encouraging   healthy   living   in   urban areas
o    Addressing   mental   health awareness
4.          Core   Features: The   app   must include at   least six   main features that   directly   contribute   to   solving the chosen   problem.   Each team   member   is   required to develop at   least two   functions as   part of the overall   app functionality.
Features   Related to   Lecture   Material:
•               Basic   UI
•             User   Interaction
•             Material   Design
•            App   Architecture
•             Navigation
•             Responsive   UI
•             Data from   the   Internet
•             Data   Storage   I
•               Data Storage   II
•            Additional and Advanced   Features
Project   Requirements:
•             Individual Responsibilities:   Each group   member   must develop two functions within the   app.   During the evaluation, each   member will   be asked to explain   and   demonstrate   the   part   they developed.   Be   prepared to discuss   the technical aspects代 写TTTK2323 Mobile Programming Course Project: Group AssignmentR
代做程序编程语言, code structure,   and functionality   of your contributions.
•             Complexity: The   project will   be graded   based on the   complexity of the following elements:
o    Navigation:   Implement smooth and   intuitive   navigation across   multiple screens.
o    Data Storage:   Use   persistent data storage   methods   (e.g.,   SQLite,   Room   Database,   Firebase).
o    User   Interaction:   Include dynamic   user   interaction such as forms,   buttons,   and   gesture controls.
o    Innovative   Features:   It is strongly encouraged   to   incorporate   at   least   one   advanced   technology to increase   data complexity.   Examples   include:
               Using   device   sensors   (e.g.,   GPS,accelerometer)
               Camera   integration   (e.g., for scanning QR codes)
               Machine learning components   (e.g., for   image   recognition)
               AR (Augmented   Reality) or VR features
               Cloud-based solutions   (e.g.,   Firebase, AWS)
Originality: Your   project   must   be original.   Plagiarism of code from any   source will   result   in   an   automatic zero for the   project. You   may   refer to examples and   pre-existing   code   but   must write the   functionality yourself.
Project   Milestones:
•             Progress   Evaluation   1 (5%):   Initial   idea and   basic app   structure.
1.          3-Minute   Demo Video:   Record   and   submit   a   3-minute video   demonstrating   an   interview   to identify the app's   requirements.
2.             Layout Sketch:   Provide a sketch of the   app’slayout.
3.             Partial   Layout   Development (20%):   Develop   part of the   layout   based on   knowledge from   Lecture   1 to   Lecture   3.
•             Progress Evaluation 2 (5%):   Functional   prototype with   core features.
•             Final   Presentation (20%): A complete and   polished app,   with   a   demonstration   of   all   features   and a clear explanation of the   technology   used.
Innovation and   Impact: Your app should show an   element of   innovation   and   be   useful   to   society.   Think creatively and aim to   build an app   that   makes   a   difference   in   solving   the   problem   you've chosen.
